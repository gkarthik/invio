# Invio

Plot incidence rates and case counts.

The script broadly has three parts,
1. Compute incidence rates and case counts.
2. Read shapefile of country/region and create polygons
3. Animate incidence rates and case counts with tweening

## Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Output

Video output: [yearly_incidence_rate_usa.mp4](./scripts/yearly_incidence_rate_usa.mp4)

## TODO

* Generalize invio.py to accept shapefile, incidence rates and case counts
